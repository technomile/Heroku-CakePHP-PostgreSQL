[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) provides the tools and services you need to build and deploy customer-facing applications without having to worry about infrastructure.

[CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC. Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.
